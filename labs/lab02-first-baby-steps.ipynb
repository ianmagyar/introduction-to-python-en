Ritchie used it in their textbook for C called *The C Programming Language* (1978). Kernighan used the program earlier, in 1974 at Bell Laboratories. The overall first use for teaching purposes was in 1972, in Kernighan's book called *A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B*.\n",

In Python we use the [`print`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function for output.\n",
