    "Our sample example will be the processing of a list of football results and the generation of a league table based on these results. [At this link](sources/lab04/buli_results.txt) you will find a file named `buli_results.txt`, which contains the results of matches from the first 23 rounds of the German Bundesliga.

As is generally the case in football, the team that scores more goals wins the match and gets 3 points. If both teams score the same number of goals (or neither team scores a goal), they both leave the match with 1 point. Teams do not get a point for a loss. \n",
