    "Before we start programming, we need to prepare the programming environment. The newest version of Python is 3.11, [which is available here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On this course we will use Python **3**, so if you already have an older version of Python 3 installed, that will be fine - we recommend however at least version **3.8**. The labs were tested on versions 3.9 and 3.10. [To review the changes specific to Python 3.11, check out the documentation.](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html)\n",

Anaconda is a platform for supporting data science and machine learning and apart from the basic Python language it also includes the most commonly used libraries such as *numpy*, *pandas*, *matplotlib* a *scikit-learn*, some of which we will use throughout the semester."

At the end of installing Anaconda you can also opt for installing [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), which is available for free in its Community Version. Developing programs in Python is also available in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).\n",
