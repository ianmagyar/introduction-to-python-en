    "# Lab 6: When to party?\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't know how many of you have experienced Jedlička, but we can probably agree that the start of a new semester should be celebrated properly. Normally, Jedlička is the best place to do this in Košice, and since the school's job is also to prepare you for life's tough decisions, for today's exercise we're going to focus on a question of huge importance: what time should you go to this great party?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course no student is going to say no to a party, but on the other hand, you are all responsible (or so we assume for the duration of this exercise) and you know that the day after Jedlička you have to be at no less important lectures and labs, which is why you have decided to come to Jedlička for only one hour. So the question is, when to do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively solve this dilemma, you asked your friends when they will go to Jedlička, and since they too are responsible, you found out that each of them will be at the party for only a few hours. Your task is to choose the most convenient hour when you will meet most of your friends, based on the list of times when your friends will be at Jedlička. For reasons as of yet unknown, you decided to implement a simple Python program to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the algorithm is a list of the intervals at which your friends will be at Jedlička. Each interval is represented by two numbers `start` and `end`, where we consider the interval closed from the left and open from the right: `<start, end)`. This means that if you arrive at Jedlička at time `start`, you will certainly meet the friend in question, but the person in question will not be at the party at time `end`. (The Swiss government has supported each of your classmates with a watch so that you can be sure that the given intervals are observed by everyone with one hundred percent certainty.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the list below as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name  | Arriving | Leaving |\n",
    "|-------|-------|-------|\n",
    "| Matt  | 9 | 10 |\n",
    "| Tom   | 10 | 12 |\n",

    "| Paul  | 8 | 11 |\n",
    "| Dan   | 10 | 11 |\n",
    "| Mary  | 12 | 2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it is most expedient to come at 10 when you meet Tom, Jerry, Paul and Dan. For more sample examples in code form ([check out the the solution skeleton](sources/lab06/lab06.py)):"
